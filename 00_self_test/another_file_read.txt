"I agree, it's not
visually interesting at all; but in order
to talk intelligently about your scissors trusses, I want
to go through a few aspects of truss design with you,
a
and a simple triangular truss is good place to start.
Let's look at the forces in its members.'
a Using a rolling ruler, the engineer drew the form of
the truss, along with arrows to indicate a load on its
apex
and reactions at its lower corners.
"I'm going to do this graphically, which is a
lot quicker than a numerical solution. I'll
put the letters A, B, and C between the
external forces and the numeral - on the
interior space of the truss, like this:"(4.3)
(A note to the reader: On the supplemental
site, under "Form and Forces Graphical
Techniques," the first interactive demonstration
concerns a
truss similar to the one being
considered here.)
