"There's something about the geometric patterns
of trusses that people seem to find fascinating.
think it's partly the way the truss members
appear to overlap in changing ways as you
walk
beneath them, and partly that the shapes of trusses
demonstrate how they work to support loads.
These trusses that you've drawn form wonderful
patterns and they give a good a shape to the interior
space. But before we go further, let me show you
a few things about trusses that will be helpful
in understanding this project. Suppose for a few
minutes that we're designing a roof truss that's just a
a
simple triangle."
